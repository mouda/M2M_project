1. Simulation scenario
	a. generate N number nodes and determine their position randomly, all of	them should stay in a circle with radius 300m. The cluster head is at 
	the central of circle. The way we generate node reside in the circle 
	uniformally is as follows:
	r = R*sqrt(rand1,N); theta = 2*pi*rand(1,N);
	x = r.*cost(theta); theta = 2*pi*rand(1,N);
	
	b.

2. Cross entropy algorithm
